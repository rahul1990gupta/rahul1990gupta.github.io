After graduating with a degree in Mathematics and Computing, I have worked for 7+ years in designing software with statistical modeling baked in. I have been fortunate to work in several domains such as hedge fund, e-commerce, marketing analytics and self-driving car with my last job. Now, I am pursuing some hobby projects in the area of NLP, Education and website development.
